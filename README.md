# Ablation Studies on Boundary-Matching Network for Temporal Action Localization

Pytorch implementation of the paper: "BMN: Boundary-Matching Network for Temporal Action Proposal Generation", along with three new modules to address overfitting issues found in the baseline model, and ablation studies for each module.

## Results
This project implements and does ablation studies with the following techniques: 
1. Temporal Shifts for Data Augmentation and Robustness
2. Global Information using a Squeeze and Excite module
3. Ensembling with a model trained on reversed videos

The following table presents results from our vanilla reproduction of the baseline, as well as the best results with all the above three component modules turned on. Ablation results for the component modules follow in the table after it.

<!-- 
| AN     | BMN Results  | Baseline Reproduction   | Improvements over Baseline   |
| ------ | ------ 		| ------ 		| ------ 		|
| AR@1   | 33.6%  		| 33.5%  		| 33.4%  		|
| AR@5   | 49.9%  		| 48.0%  		| 49.8%  		|
| AR@10  | 57.1%  		| 55.1%  		| 57.3%  		|
| AR@100 | 75.5%  		| 75.1%  		| 75.4%  		|

## Prerequisites

These code is implemented in Pytorch 1.9.1 + Python 3.8.10. 


## Download Datasets

The two-stream dataset of ActivityNet can be downloaded
 [here](https://paddlemodels.bj.bcebos.com/video_detection/bmn_feat.tar.gz). Which is taken from [this](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleVideo/blob/develop/docs/en/dataset/ActivityNet.md) repository. The two-stream dataset should be extracted into `data/activitynet_feature_cuhk/fix_feat_100` for the code to train.

## Training and Testing  of BMN

All configurations of project are saved in opts.py, where you can modify training, model, and inference parameter.

1. To train the model:
```
python main.py --mode train --experiment_name vanilla_model
```
`experiment_name` is simply the name of this experiment. It should be noted that additional parameters would be necessary to apply necessary data augmentation. These parameters include `reverse`, `max_shift`, `shift_prob`, `s_and_e`.

2. To get the inference proposal of the validation videos and evaluate the proposals with recall and AUC in a normal model, simply run the following code.

```
python main.py --mode inference --forward_model vanilla_model
```

However, to run inference proposal on the ensemble model, run the following code.

```
python main.py --mode inference --forward_model vanilla_model --reverse_model reverse_model --ensemble 1
```

## Group name change
We would like to note that our group name changed from group 9 to group 2 during the semester. Therefore, some documentation may indicate this discrepency.
